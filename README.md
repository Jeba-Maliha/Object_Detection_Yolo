# Object_Detection_Yolo
YOLO (You Only Look Once) models are real-time object detection systems that identify and classify objects in a single pass of the image. In other words, the model only looks at the image once and from this ‘single pass’ is able to identify objects in the image.
Object detection means that YOLO can not only pinpoint where an object is in an image but also what it is. This works by passing the image through a neural network that allows the model to detect all objects simultaneously. Using grid-based prediction and bounding box prediction, the model is able to understand if objects fall within a certain cell or bounding box. Additionally, YOLO uses class probability to predict how to classify objects, which determines what the object actually is.YOLO has a number of advantages in comparison to previous methods. Additionally, it has high accuracy, especially with natural images, and fewer false positives since it analyzes an entire image at once, which provides greater contextual accuracy.
